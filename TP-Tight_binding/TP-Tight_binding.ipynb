    "\n",
    "The principle of the tight-binding scheme is to consider that the electrons are tighly confined near the ionic cores (this is exactly the opposite of considering electrons as free particles). Hence, their ground is similar to that of isolated atoms located at the site of the crystalline system. The electronic wavefunction take the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\psi(\\vec{r}) \\approx \\sum_{\\vec{R}}{{\\rm exp}(i \\vec{k}.\\vec{r})}\\:\\psi_{n}(\\vec{r}-\\vec{R})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ correspond to the atomic state ($s$, $p$, $d$). An electron is such $\\psi_{n}$ state is also in a potential generated by all the others atoms. It can be considered as a weak perturbation equal to the difference between the real potential and the Coulombian atomic potential. For the corresponding atom at the $\\vec{R}$ site, this potential is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U(\\vec{r}) = -\\sum_{\\vec{R} \\neq 0}{\\frac{Z}{\\left|\\vec{r}-\\vec{R}\\right|}} < 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is weak in the region where $\\psi_{n}$ (and the associated density) is large and large in the vicinity of the neighbouring ions (where $\\psi_{n}$ is almost zero).\n",
    "The global perturbed state is written as a Bloch function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_{\\vec{R}}e^{i\\vec{k}\\vec{r}}\\phi({\\vec{r}-\\vec{R}})$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\\phi(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_{m}{b_{m}\\psi_{m}(\\vec{r})}$$\n",
    "is an atomic state, which is a linear combination of non-perturbed atomic states.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we put this ansatz in the static Schrödinger equation, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H\\psi = (H_{at} + \\Delta U)\\psi = E(\\vec{k})\\psi \\longrightarrow$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int{d\\vec{r}\\:\\psi_{m}^{*}}(\\vec{r})H\\psi(\\vec{r}) = E^{0}_{m}\\int{d\\vec{r}\\:\\psi_{m}^{*}}(\\vec{r})\\psi(\\vec{r}) + \\int{d\\vec{r}\\:\\psi_{m}^{*}}(\\vec{r})\\:\\Delta U(\\vec{r})\\:\\psi(\\vec{r})$$\n",

    "$$E(k) = E_{s}^{0} + \\frac{L + T(l)}{1+C(k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can make an additional approximation: generally, the overlap between atomic states is small, so that $C \\approx 0$. Moreover we can rewrite $E_{s}^{0} + L = -\\alpha$, so that this term account for the orbital energy of the isolated atom, as well as the correction due to the neighbouring ions. Finally, the integral in the hopping matrix is usually constant ($= -\\gamma$), so that $T(k) = -\\gamma\\:{\\rm cos(ka)}$. It remains:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(k) = -\\alpha - \\gamma\\:{\\rm cos(ka)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A plot of $E(k)$ along a specific path in the reciprocal space is known as an electronic band structure. Around the $\\Gamma$ point (0,0,0), the minimum energy can be approximated with a quadratic function, so that electron with large wavelengthes $\\lambda$ behave like free-electrons, with an effective mass $\\displaystyle m^{*} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2a^2 \\left|\\gamma \\right|}$.\n",
    "Hence, the largest the hopping, the lighter the electrons will behave, for example if they are compelled to move in a given direction by an external electric field.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### In practice\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this laboratory, we'll be using Python as well as the PythTB package developped by Coh and Vanderbilt (http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/). This package allows one to create lattices of orbitals, with a set of parameters to fix the integrals values. It can be exploited to create elaborate electronic structures of real materials. \n",

    "In this exercice, we start with a real 2D material, graphene. The structure of graphene is that of a honeycomb lattice composed of carbon atoms C, providing each 6 electrons. In the case of graphene, the $\\left|s\\right\\rangle$, $\\left|p_x\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|p_y\\right\\rangle$ orbitals hybridizes as 3 $\\left|sp\\right\\rangle$ orbitals, involved in cohesion of the lattice, whereas the remaining $\\left|p_z\\right\\rangle$ states are involved with transport near the Fermi level. Hence, in the following TB calculation, we only consider these electrons: in the plane of the lattice, the $\\left|p_z\\right\\rangle$ orbitals have a circular symmetry (as that of $\\left|s\\right\\rangle$ orbitals), and we only need to set the hopping to the nearest neighbours (3)."
