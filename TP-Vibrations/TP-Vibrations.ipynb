    "### a) Purpose of the current lab\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this session is to review the problem of harmonic vibrations in solids using a simple model: the 1-dimensional chain of atoms. In such a way, we retrains the number of degrees of freedom considerably while keeping a handful of significant physics. One-dimensional lattice can be as simple as the monoatomic chain of atoms, yet they can nevertheless becomes much more complex, with differents atoms (and interactions) within the Bravais lattice. Hence, even with simple 1D lattices, we often ends up with problems that cannot be solved easily. Moreover, letting the computer calculate the physical quantities and leaving humans performs more interesting tasks is a perfectly fine option.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The current session deals with the following:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> A smaller reminder for the 1D monoatomic lattice</li>\n",
    "    <li> Effects of second and third neighbours, and generalization</li>\n",
    "    <li> The 1D diatomic lattice: solving the equations by diagonalization of the dynamical matrix</li>\n",
    "    <li> The 1D triatomic lattice: witnessing the Brillouin zone folding using larger unit cells containing 3 atoms</li>\n",
    "    <li> The 1D lattice: generalization for N atoms per unit cell: introduction to superlattices, and effects of point-defects</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Scripting with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this session, we will run embedded Python scripts (<a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">https://www.python.org/</a>). Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which is quite popular amongst scientists, with its simple syntax and a large amount of libraries for scientific computing. Even if you are not familiar with Python, all the scripts below are already done, and the only thing you'll need to change is the value of some variables (used as parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Here are some comments about specific aspects of Python scripting:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Some parameters will be stocked in arrays known as <i>lists</i> in Python, declared using <code>list_name = []</code>. For examples, the list of atoms of masses $M_i$ can be declared as <code>M = [1., 2.]</code>, which means that $M_1$ = 1 and $M_2$ = 2. Note that, similarly to C++, the index of arrays start at 0, meaning that <code>M[0] = 1</code>, <code>M[1] = 2</code>.</li>\n",
    "    <li> We make use of the <a href=\"https://numpy.org/\">NumPy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scipy.org/\">SciPy</a> libraries, providing useful functionalities for array manipulations and linear algebra applications. The results are plotted using the <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">MatPlotLib</a> library. These do not come with Python, yet have been installed on the server running this notebook.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Loop can be performed using the <code>for</code> command (examples <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach_loop#Python\"> here</a>).</li>\n",
    "    <li> As Python is interpreted, it may take some time before the results display. You can eventually tune the setting to limit the number of calculations, like tuning the number of k point where the dynamical matrix is diagonalized.</li>\n",

The precision on the density depends on a number of parameters, such as the sampling in k-space and the interval of summation at a given $\\omega$. In principle, convergence should be reached through an iterative process. As the sampling is finite, then the calculated DOS is finite."

The next script deals with the 1-D lattice with N atoms inside the primitive cell, with interaction limited between first nearest neighbours. Therefore, one must set all the masses $M_i$ and forces constants $C_i$ ($i$ = 1, ..., N) in a Python list to generate the dynamical matrix using the <code>dyn_mat_Nat(k)</code> code (N $\\geq$ 3).\n",

This allows one to keep the translational symmetry, while explicitely treating the impurity within the large supercell. In this example, the defect density is 1/N, where N is the number of atoms in the cell. You will model the impurity using a 30 atoms supercells mimicking the diatomic lattice with $M_1$ = 1 and $M_2$ = 5 with $C_i$ = 4 ($i$ = 1, ..., 30), as above. This can be done using a loop as written below. Change one atom of mass $M$ = 1 to one of mass $M$ = 2 (the impurity). What is happening ? Try changing the mass of the impurity: $M$ = 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5...  How does the mass of the impurity affect the DOS ?\n",
